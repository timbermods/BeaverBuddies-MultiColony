     * The game runs part of every Wonder, and all of the Iron Teeth Earth Repopulator's plane
     * launch, on render-frame time: a Wonder's activation animation (AnimatorRegistry, Time.deltaTime)
     * and the check for its end (WonderAnimationController.Update), the catapult's wait and runway
     * (PlaneCatapult.Update), the plane's movement along the runway (Plane.Update) and the turn of
     * the launcher between planes (PlaneLauncherRotator.Update). Their ends spawn the next plane,
     * deactivate the Wonder (its effect stops and the pilots are destroyed half an hour later) and
     * decide whether a Wonder can be activated again. A player at a different frame rate, or a guest
     * waiting for the host while its frames go on, reaches each of them on a different tick, and
     * the planes are created outside a tick, so with entity IDs from the wrong random numbers.
     *
     * In multiplayer the tick runs them instead: once per tick, in a fixed order, with the tick
     * interval as their clock, calling the game's own methods. The per-frame updates only draw,
     * between the last two ticks' poses, and never change what the simulation reads.
     * See BeaverBuddies/Doc/WonderTiming.md.
     *
     * Ported from the Stability Fork's PR #46 (not merged there), with one change: a game update that changes how
     * often these methods read the frame clock no longer throws out of the mod's patching (which would have left the
     * mod half patched, its desync fixes included). The transpiler leaves that method as the game has it, logs it, and
     * switches this whole takeover off (WonderTiming.Unavailable): the Wonders then run on frame time as before 1.4.0-beta12.
