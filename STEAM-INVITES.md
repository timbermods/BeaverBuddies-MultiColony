# Steam invites

Invite a Steam friend into your hosted game from Steam's own overlay. This is an
**alternative to direct IP**, not a replacement: both are offered at the same time when
you host, so Hamachi / port forwarding / direct IP keep working exactly as before.

## Using it

**Host**
1. Make sure **Enable Steam Networking** is on in Mod Settings (it is by default).
2. Load your save and choose **Host co-op game**.
3. Choose **Invite Friends** and pick your friend in the Steam overlay.
4. Choose **Start Game** once your friend appears in the connected-player list, and then **wait, paused, until
   everyone is in**: place or mark nothing meanwhile. In MultiColony, joining closes at the host's first tick or at
   the first change to the game, whichever comes first (a later joiner would be sent the save without it).

**Friend**
- Accept the invite (Steam notification or overlay). If Timberborn is not running, Steam
  launches it and joins for you. With **Allow Friends to Join Directly via Steam** on, a
  friend can also use **Join Game** from Steam's friends list.
- Both players need the same BeaverBuddies build and the game version must match. Since 1.4.0-alpha11 the
  mod's own `Buildings` and `TemplateCollections` files are part of that check: a copy with them missing or
  edited is refused with a *build mismatch* message, not merely warned about.
- **Your colony follows your Steam account** in a separate-colonies game (MultiColony): the save remembers each
  player by their Steam ID, so you get the same colony every time, whoever hosts. Without Steam an id kept on your
  computer is used instead. If your Steam account changes, you join as a new player and the host hands your old
  colony to you from the **Ctrl+T** window.

Nobody can join once the game has started, or once the host changed anything while it waited paused. An old
invite then says the host already started (or already changed the game), instead of hanging; the host saves,
rehosts and sends a new one.

No port forwarding or Hamachi is needed. Connections go directly between players when
Steam can find a route, and are otherwise relayed through Steam's network. Valve documents
that relaying prevents players' IP addresses from being revealed to each other.

## How it works

Previously this used Valve's legacy `ISteamNetworking` P2P API, which Valve marks
deprecated ("we may remove this API from the SDK in a future release"). It now uses
`ISteamNetworkingSockets`, the API Valve recommends, which ships in the game's own
Steamworks assembly.

- **Lobby.** The host opens a friends-only Steam lobby; that is what the overlay invites
  into. Lobby data records whether the host is still accepting players, and is set to closed at the
  first tick or the first game-changing action while paused, so an old invite explains itself instead
  of hanging.
- **Admission.** The host accepts a connection only from a player who is in its lobby, so a
  stranger who knows a Steam ID cannot connect. A guest that appears before the host's lobby
  view catches up gets a five-second grace period.
- **One thread for Steam.** Every Steam call happens on the game's main thread, where Steam
  callbacks are delivered. TimberNet's threads use plain in-memory queues. `Write` never
  blocks (a blocked game thread would stop the pump that drains the queue) and `Read`
  blocks on a queue the pump fills. Steam's documentation does not promise these calls are
  safe from other threads, so nothing depends on it.
- **Pumped between ticks too.** The pump runs once per frame, and also in the game's tick loop
  between the buckets of a tick, at most once a millisecond and right after a tick's events
  are queued for the guests. A frame at a high game speed is mostly simulation, so data
  would otherwise wait for the end of it, in both directions, and the ping grew with the
  speed. Only data transfer runs there (no state changes, closing or admission), on the same
  thread as everything else. The log reports how long data waited once a minute.
- **The overlay and dialogs.** While Steam's overlay is open the game pushes an empty panel that
  blocks input, and pops it when the overlay closes, but only if it is still on top. If a dialog
  opened over it in between (an invite that cannot be joined, a connection error), the panel used
  to stay for good and swallow every key press. It is now removed as soon as the dialog above it is
  closed.
- **Connecting in the background.** The connection completes after `ConnectAsync` returns.
  The client waits for it on a worker thread (up to 45 s) before the compatibility
  handshake's own 15 s clock starts. `TimberClient.Start()` used to wait 3 s on the game
  thread, which a transport that needs the game thread could never satisfy.
- **Speed.** Steam's defaults cap a connection at 256 KB/s with a 512 KB send buffer. The
  mod raises the send rate ceiling to 8 MB/s and the send buffer to 4 MB, so the initial
  save transfer is not throttled. If Steam's buffer fills, data stays queued and is
  retried next frame; nothing is dropped and message order is preserved.
- **Never hangs silently.** A send that makes no progress for 30 s, a connect that takes
  over 40 s, or a queue that grows past 128 MB fails the connection with an explanation.
  Steam's own end reason is translated into plain language and shown in the error and in
  the log, for example "The connection timed out. Steam could not find a working route
  between you. (Steam code 5003: ...)".
- **Steam can never break hosting.** If Steam fails to start, direct-IP hosting continues.
- **Closing.** Local close flushes queued data for up to 3 s before closing, and data the
  peer sent before closing is still delivered before end-of-stream.

## Validation

`dotnet run --project StabilityTests` runs the production transport (`SteamLinkSocket`,
`SteamLinkManager`) against a fake Steam network. The fake **fails any test that calls
Steam off the game thread**, rejects messages over Steam's 512 KB limit, and uses a small
send buffer to force backpressure. It covers: background connect; byte-exact ordered
transfer of 3 MB through a tiny buffer; write coalescing; `Write` never blocking with the
pump stopped; the queue cap; failure explanations; connect timeout; the stall detector;
draining before end-of-stream; close and idempotent close; one bad connection not affecting
another; lobby-only admission with the grace period; duplicate arrival notices; replacing
an unstopped listener; a full TimberNet session (handshake, a 2 MB save, events and
player activity in both directions) over the Steam transport; and protocol parity: one
scripted session (about 60 events each way, one of 220 KB, plus cursor traffic) is run over
a direct connection and over Steam under stress, and both peers must end with identical
events and state hashes. Corrupting a single byte in the Steam path makes these fail.

**Confirmed with a real Steam friend** in playtests between the maintainer and a friend,
including a session at a true speed 7 with the ping under 100 ms. The automated checks cannot
run Steam itself: the thin layer that calls Steam (`SteamLinkBackend`, `SteamNet`,
`SteamListener`, `SteamOverlayConnectionService`) compiles against the game's real Steamworks
assembly and is exercised only in the game, which needs two Steam accounts. The overlay panel
fix and the pumping between ticks are covered by checks on their decisions, not by a Steam session.

## Two-account playtest

1. Host with Steam Networking on. In `Player.log` expect:
   `Steam networking started`, `Steam relay network: Current`, `Steam is listening for players`,
   `Steam lobby created with ID ...`.
2. Choose **Invite Friends**; the overlay should open. If not, the log says the lobby is not
   ready yet.
3. Friend accepts. Expect `Steam link to <name>: accepted` then `... Connecting -> Connected`
   on the host, and the friend appears in the connected-player list.
4. Start the game, play, then have the friend leave. Confirm the host keeps running. In MultiColony, from the
   next in-game day the **Ctrl+T** window shows the friend's colony as away, and the host may hand it over.
5. Repeat with the friend's game **closed** when they accept (tests the launch invite).
6. Repeat with an invite sent **after** Start Game (expect the "already started" message), and once with an
   invite sent after the host placed a path while still paused (expect the "already changed the game" message).
6a. Rejoin the same save later with the friend hosting it: in MultiColony each of you gets the same colony as
    before (`[Colony] Player … plays slot …` in the log).
7. Host with Steam Networking **off** and confirm direct IP works as before.

If something fails, send both `Player.log` files. Every state change and close is logged with
Steam's numeric end reason and debug text, which is what makes a failure diagnosable.

## Known limits

- Both players must be online in Steam, and the friend must own Timberborn.
- Joining after **Start Game**, or after the host changed anything while waiting paused, is not possible.
  After a desync, the host uses **Save and rehost** and Steam guests accept a fresh invite; in MultiColony a
  guest whose colony state differs from the host's stops the tick it happens (since 1.4.0-alpha13), so the
  rehost may come sooner than the game's random-state check alone would have asked for.
- The **Invite Friends** button does nothing for the first moment after hosting starts,
  until the lobby exists; click it again.
- New strings are English only; other languages fall back to English.
