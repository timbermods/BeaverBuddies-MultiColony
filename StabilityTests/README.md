# Stability regression checks

The suite includes fragmented-stream handshake tests for matching, mismatched and
legacy peers, timeout cleanup, and failure notification in both directions.
The production ReplayExecution helper is tested with partial mutation, an error
handler that also throws, and early-stop/nested-scope cases.

RuntimeChecks also invokes all ten production RNG scope prefixes/finalizers
with nesting and cleanup, and checks restoration of the ticker flag. To attempt
actual Harmony patch installation on a managed fixture, set
`BEAVERBUDDIES_TEST_HARMONY=1`. This optional integration test fails under the
current .NET 8 harness because the installed MonoMod dependency cannot access
SignatureHelper.GetMethodSigHelper. It is not counted in the passing checks;
live Unity/Harmony installation is not exercised by these checks.

Run `dotnet run --project StabilityTests` from the repository root with .NET 8.
This builds TimberNet and links the production SteamLinkSocket, SteamLinkManager,
connection panel model, player cursor preferences and animation patch source. Steam and Unity APIs are test doubles; no game or
Steam client is required. Animation tests model a forward-only path cursor and
invalid visual coordinates, not a running Unity water simulation.

`dotnet run --project StabilityTests -- --ping-report` prints how the ping shown over Steam
depends on the players' frame length, with Steam served once per frame and with it also served
between the ticks of a frame. It runs the real transport, server, client and ping tracker over a
fake Steam network with a fixed delay and takes about a minute and a half.

To compare against another checkout:
`dotnet run --project StabilityTests -p:SourceRoot=/absolute/path/to/checkout`

The separate RuntimeChecks executable tests the actual compiled mod's RNG
wrappers and save flags using the installed game's managed assemblies. It also
runs the actual managed UpdateWaterSourcesTask on a small overlapping-source
fixture, verifies identical results across six registration orders after the
ordering fix, and checks water diagnostic snapshots and field hashes:

```
dotnet run --project RuntimeChecks -- /path/to/BeaverBuddies.dll /path/to/Timberborn_Data/Managed /path/to/Harmony-directory
```

RuntimeChecks also checks which types a multiplayer frame may create. Frames are read with
Newtonsoft's `TypeNameHandling.All`, so every `$type` in one names a type to create, and the
`ReplayEventBinder` only lets actions and what they carry through. A frame that names any other type
(a harmless sentinel stands in for a dangerous one), or a list, array or map of it, is refused before
anything is created. Every action the mod sends reads back unchanged through the same path the
network uses, with every field filled in (separate colonies' `ColonyStartingSettings` included), and
is written exactly as it is without the binder, so the event hash does not change. Actions from
another mod's assembly loaded from bytes (standing in for MixedStorage's `StorageAllocationEvent`)
pass, with the classes they declare.

Both executables exit nonzero on failure. Neither verifies full multiplayer
determinism or executes Unity's native simulation. Build BeaverBuddies using
the repository's env.props setup before running RuntimeChecks.

RuntimeChecks also clones the installed game's depth-source modifier IL, substitutes
a controlled frame clock and depth-query stub, and exercises the production
timing transpiler. It reproduces frame-rate-dependent output before the patch
and checks matching ramp values after it. This tests the real ramp arithmetic
and emitted patch, but not Harmony installation inside Unity or depth sensing.

Water diagnostic ZIPs can be compared with Python (no extra packages):

```
python RuntimeChecks/compare_water_snapshots.py host-water.zip client-water.zip
python -m unittest discover -s RuntimeChecks -p "test_water_snapshots.py"
```
