# Player activity indicators

Other players' cursors, selections and building activity are
shown on your screen, and you can restyle each player's cursor. In a MultiColony game (a colony each, see
[TWO-COLONIES.md](TWO-COLONIES.md)) all of this works across colonies: you see the other colony's player at work on
their side of the map as you would a teammate.

## What you see

- **Colored, translucent cursors** with a name label. Positions are shared in world
  space, so cameras can be at different positions and zoom levels, and markers
  interpolate between samples. A cursor over UI, outside the game window or off the
  map is hidden; losing application focus hides yours too.
- **Finding a player.** Click a player's row in the connection panel to take your camera to their cursor (or to
  what they have selected, when their cursor is off the map); your own row, or the Home key, takes you back to your
  own colony. Display only: nothing is sent.
- **Remote selection outlines.** Remote selected entities use Timberborn's native
  selection outline in that player's color. Each remote player has an independent
  secondary highlighter, and your own selection/hover colors take priority when you
  select the same object. Selecting an object never changes anyone else's selection
  or camera. This shares entity selections, not construction ghosts or drag-to-paint
  tool areas.
- **Viewing / Editing labels.** A selected building shows **Viewing: player name**.
  Issuing a building command through the mod's common entity-action path (recipes,
  worker counts, rename, priorities, water settings, automation) shows **Editing:
  player name** for three seconds after the most recent change. Viewing is never
  reported as editing. This is an advisory notice, not a lock: both players can still
  change a building, and the normal multiplayer command order decides the result.
  Third-party UI that bypasses BeaverBuddies' entity-action path cannot emit an edit
  notice, and zipline tools and global technology unlocks are not covered. In a separate-colonies game the notice is
  sent when the command is made, before the host judges it: a change to another colony's building, which the host
  refuses, can still show **Editing** on other screens for its three seconds, although nothing changes.

## In a separate-colonies game

- **Cursor colors are the player's; colony colors are the colony's.** The land outlines (Ctrl+L, or while a tool is
  in hand), the *(colony N)* beside a name in the connection panel and the colony names in the trading window use
  the game's own start colors, one per colony. The cursor, name label, selection outline and chat name use the color
  the player chose (or the one you set for them under **Player cursors**), or, while they have not chosen one, a
  color by player number (see *Settings* below). A player and their colony need not match.
- **Selection outlines cross colonies.** Selecting another colony's building shows it to everyone as any selection
  is; opening its panels changes nothing (see *What you see* in TWO-COLONIES.md).
- **Pings** are shared by everyone, whichever colony pinged.
- **Who is who** is the connection panel's job: each name there carries the colony its player runs. The cursor
  label shows the name only.

## Customizing each player's cursor

Open the in-game **Options** menu (Esc) and choose **Player cursors**. Each connected
player who is sharing activity gets a card with:

| Control | Range | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color | **Their color** (what they chose), 10 presets, or exact Red/Green/Blue sliders | Their color |
| Size | 50%–300% | 100% |
| Transparency | 0%–90% | 50% |

The color also applies to that player's name label, their selection outline and their name in the
chat in the connection panel, so a player always looks like one consistent color. The swatch in each card previews the
color and transparency live, and **Reset** returns that player to the defaults.

The first card, **You, in the chat** (1.4.0-beta6), is for your own name in the chat as you see it: the
**Default** swatch (what others see: your Ping Color, or the color for your player number while it is
still the default), the same ten presets, or the Red/Green/Blue sliders; **Reset** returns to the default.
It has no size or transparency, since there is no cursor of your own to draw, and it is on your screen
only: nothing is sent, and other players' choices for you still win on their screens. It is saved with
the other styles, under the key `#you`.

These are **display-only, local choices**. They are never sent over the network, so
each player can style everyone else differently, and they cannot affect the
simulation.

Styles are remembered **by display name** (for example "Sarah"), so a friend keeps the
same look next time even though their player number changes. If two connected players
share a name, each is keyed by name plus player number so they can be styled
separately. Styles are saved as you edit, to
`BeaverBuddiesCursorStyles.json` in the game's persistent data folder
(`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Mechanistry\Timberborn`). A missing, damaged or
read-only file just means default styles; values are clamped when loaded.

A player appears in the panel while they are connected and sharing. If someone turns
sharing off, they disappear from the list until they turn it back on.

## Settings

In Mod Settings, **Player activity indicators** turns sharing and display on or off.
**Ping Display Name** and **Ping Color** are the name and color other players see for
you here, and on your pings. Pick different names and colors for easier
identification; connection labels distinguish players even if their names match.
While **Ping Color** is left on its default yellow, other players see a color of their own by player
number instead (the host orange, then blue, green, pink, purple, teal, red and lime for the guests as
they join, repeating after eight), so players who never touch the setting still look different. Any
other color, even a slightly different yellow, is kept as chosen. The swatch called **Their color** in
**Player cursors** shows that color, and your own choices there still win. The color you see your own
name in, in the chat, is the **You, in the chat** card's there (1.4.0-beta6). Pings always use the Ping
Color as set, yellow by default. (From Stability Fork 1.1.11.)
A host who disables their own display still relays other guests' activity.

## Performance and synchronization

- At most ten samples per second using unscaled time, including while paused. No
  catch-up bursts on slow frames, and no dependence on simulation speed.
- Activity frames use the existing TCP/Steam connection but are handled **outside the
  replay script and the desync hash**: they are intercepted on the receive thread
  before they can reach the event queue, so they cannot change tick order, replay, or
  hash state. The host assigns each guest's identity; a guest cannot claim another
  player's id. The host is player 0.
- Sending never blocks the game thread. Each connection keeps only the newest pending
  state per player and is drained by a single pooled task, and every frame goes
  through the same length-framed, stream-locked write path as gameplay events, so an
  activity frame cannot split a reliable event.
- A joining guest is not sent any activity until its map, state and init frames have
  been written, and a guest does not send until it has received the map.
- Incoming activity is validated (coordinates, ids, colors, name length, key count);
  a malformed frame is dropped and never ends the session. The receive mailbox keeps
  at most 64 latest states. Remote displays expire after three seconds without
  updates, and reload, session change, disable and disconnect clear overlays and
  highlights. Missing or deleted entities are ignored. No selectable objects, colliders
  or input controls are created, and no per-frame scene scans or gameplay random calls
  are used.
- If the overlay ever throws, it disables itself for that scene rather than affecting
  the game.

Because the build-compatibility handshake already requires identical mod builds,
every player in a session has this feature or none of them do.

## Validation

`dotnet run --project StabilityTests` (348 checks in 1.4.0-beta11, of which the activity checks are described
here) covers:

- the production transport over in-memory streams with a host and two guests:
  identity assignment (a guest claiming another id is ignored), relay without echo,
  no change to hash / script / tick progress, dropped malformed frames, gameplay
  ordering under an activity flood, a joining guest receiving map -> state -> init
  before any activity, and disconnect cleanup;
- message validation, name sanitizing, the latest-wins mailbox and its cap, and the
  outgoing coalescing channel;
- the per-player style store: clamping, hostile or damaged files, entry caps, atomic
  save and reload, unwritable locations, and name-collision keys;
- your own chat color (1.4.0-beta6): kept under a key no name can take, dropped when back to
  the default, saved and reloaded, an older file read as before, and every string the dialog asks
  for present in the English file.

`dotnet run --project RuntimeChecks -- <BeaverBuddies.dll> <Timberborn Managed>
<Harmony dir> <ModSettings Scripts dir>` (278 checks in 1.4.0-beta11) still passes against the
compiled mod.

**Not covered by automated tests:** how the cursor, labels and outlines actually
render, and the settings dialog's layout and slider behavior. Those need the real
game.

## Two-player playtest

1. Install the same build on every computer and restart. Confirm **Player activity
   indicators** appears in Mod Settings, and pick distinct names and colors.
2. Host and join normally. Move around the same building from different camera
   angles; check cursor position on terrain and building surfaces.
3. Select different buildings, then the same one. Check outlines and name labels,
   that your own selection color wins, and that you can scroll and click through a
   cursor marker.
4. Change a recipe, worker count or automation setting. **Editing** should appear for
   three seconds; merely leaving a panel open should show **Viewing**.
5. Open Options -> **Player cursors**. Check the other player's card and that
   dragging each slider updates their cursor live: color presets, RGB, Size and
   Transparency. Use **Reset**, close and reopen the dialog, then restart the game and
   confirm the style is remembered. In the first card, **You, in the chat**, pick a
   preset: your own name in the chat changes on your screen within a moment and not on
   the other player's; **Reset** returns it to the default.
6. Have a third player join (or rename one) while the dialog is open and confirm the
   list updates. Try two players with the same name.
7. Repeat while paused and at faster speeds. Hover UI, alt-tab, disable and re-enable
   activity, remove a selected building, and disconnect a guest; stale marks should
   clear within about three seconds.
8. In a separate-colonies game: select the other colony's building (the outline shows on their screen, in your
   cursor color); try to change it: refused, and on their screen **Editing** shows for at most three seconds with
   nothing changed; press Ctrl+L and check the land outlines are the colonies' colors, not the cursors'.
